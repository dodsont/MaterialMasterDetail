# Material Master/Detail

Android Application sample of how to implement Master/Detail pattern that follows Material Design visual language.

It is a Kotlin porting of Lucas Urbas's sample (see his article on [this link](http://goo.gl/ex8MVd)).
I also tried to simplify it and did some graphical changes to better suit my taste (up to you to like it or not).

Be sure to check this sample on Mobile as well as on Tablet!
